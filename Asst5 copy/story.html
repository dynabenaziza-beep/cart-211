        “I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan.
        I was going to become an actress, get a role on All My Children, meet
        my husband on set–and when that was all over, I’d host a talk show.
        Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. Back then it seemed like every
        woman on television had gotten their start as beauty queen. So my senior
        year I decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was
        organized like a Ms. America pageant. But this was a rough high school,
        only one other girl signed up, so I had a good shot. My whole family got
        behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we
        watched, the winner wore a white dress. So she sewed me a white dress
        that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine.
      </p>

      <p>
        First came the interview portion, and that’s when the trouble started.
        The judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn’t ready for that.
        I was ready for world peace. They were supposed to ask me about my goals,
        so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent portion was
        later that night at the homecoming dance. The whole school was there.
        I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not the right crowd for that.
        The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the
        whole crowd singing along. That’s when I knew it was over.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and
        announced the winner: it was me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment.
        Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me. But it only
        lasted five seconds, because the guidance counselor said:
        ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the runner-up.’ It was the worst
        moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID
        was knowing that it could not possibly, possibly be worse than that moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor?
        Several years later I ended up acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College.
        In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and the director was like:
        ‘We need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’
        I was like: ‘Well, that’s easy. His father ruined my senior year.
        And quite possibly, my entire life.’”
