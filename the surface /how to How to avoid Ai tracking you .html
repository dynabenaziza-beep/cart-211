                <p class="description" style="max-width:520px;">
                    AI systems collect data in the background — but you can reduce what you share.
                    Here are quick, simple steps to protect your personal information online.
                </p>

                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li>Use nicknames or initials</li>
                        <li>Avoid uploading unnecessary files/photos</li>
                        <li>Skip optional form fields</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
    <p>
        The interface slowly becomes unstable. A scan appears. A glitch shows up. 
        The user begins to understand that the system is quietly observing them. 
        Near the end the entire window breaks and an error message reveals the truth.
        The AI was active since the beginning and the personality test was only a disguise.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project explores the idea that modern machine learning systems do not need direct input
        to learn about people. They learn from the way users move, think and react. The experiment
        highlights how AI can blend into everyday websites while collecting behavioral patterns in
        subtle ways.
    </p>

    <p>
        The aesthetic is part of the message. By choosing an old computer style, I wanted the viewer
        to feel safe and nostalgic. The AI hides inside an interface that looks simple and harmless.
        This creates a contrast between the design and the real intention of the system.

    <h3>Aesthetic Choices</h3>

    <p>
        The visual style of this project is inspired by <b>early-2000s computer interfaces</b>.
        Everything from the light blue borders to the pixel-style layout is made to
        look playful and familiar but also slightly outdated, which helps hide the presence
        of the “AI.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The color palette uses <b>soft blues (#d4e3ff, #eef3ff, #7aa2ff)</b> because these
        were common in Windows XP and early internet webpages. The white window with blue borders 
        creates a clean and friendly look, which contrasts with the secret AI behavior underneath.
    </p>

    <p>
        The font is a simple system font (<b>Arial</b>), chosen because it feels like an old 
        default browser setting and keeps the interface looking basic and harmless.
    </p>

    <p>
        The small boxes, buttons, and retro icons imitate the look of early websites that 
        used tables and simple blocks. This keeps the experience feeling nostalgic and makes the
        AI reveal more surprising when it happens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, the aesthetic reinforces the concept:  
        <i>a cute, safe-looking interface hiding something deeper beneath the surface.</i>
